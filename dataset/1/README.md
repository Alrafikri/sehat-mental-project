**Abstract:**

This study investigated the psychological factors of derailment, self-criticism and self-reassurance, previously demonstrated to influence depression, aiming to identify individual differences within and between the UK student and general population indicating those at higher risk. Participants completed self-report construct measures. Correlation and path analyses were used to assess relationships and test direction. Derailment and self-criticism predicted depression increase, whereas self-reassurance protected against depression. Self-criticism mediated derailment’s effect on depression. Self-reassurance moderated derailment’s effect on depression, though did not moderate the effect of derailment induced self-criticism on depression. Students were at higher risk of derailment and consequent depression. Depression treatment should therefore counter derailment, since derailment indicates a risk of depression through increased self-criticism or low self-reassurance, particularly in students.
